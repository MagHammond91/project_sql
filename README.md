# BACKGROUND
Driven by my personal quest to transition into a data scientist role, this project was born from a desire to identify top-paying and in-demand skills, streamlining my own path to find optimal opportunities. 

This data is from my [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql), which provides comprehensive insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### THE QUESTIONS I ANSWERED THROUGH MY SQL QUERIES WERE:

1. What are the top-paying data scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are the most in demand for the data scientist?
4. What skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the mosst optimal skills to learn?


# TOOLS I USED
To thoroughly explore the data scientist job market, I utilized several key tools:

- **SQL**: The core of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract crucial insights.

- **MSSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio)**: The selected database management system, perfect for managing the job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code**: My preferred tool for database management and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub**: Vital for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analyses, facilitating collaboration and project tracking.
